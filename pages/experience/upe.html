    <h1>WHAT IS UPSILON PI EPSILON?</h1>
    <p>
      Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE) at BU is an honor society dedicated to promoting
      excellence in technical and computing disciplines. UPE at BU will help
      prepare members for the industry through professional development,
      meaningful and thought-provoking projects, and a supportive professional

        <h2>DIRECTOR OF RECRUITMENT</h2>
        <p>
            I currently serve as the Director of Recruitment for the BU UPE
            Chapter. My term will last through the 2021 - 2022 Academic Year at
            Boston University, and I am a member of the Epsilon Class.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
            As the Director of Recruitment, I am responsible for the execution
            of UPE's recruitment process. More specifically, my responsibilities
            are as follows.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Planning events for new potential members. These events can be
                informative, professional, or social and occur throughout the
                recruitment season to ensure all interested students can attend.
            </li>
            <li>
                Facilitating the application process for potential new members.
                This includes creating the general application form, devising
                and selecting programming and logic-based questions for
                applicant interviews, and organizing the logistics, from various
                perspectives, for the interviews.
            </li>
            <li>
                Running deliberation as current UPE members vote for the
                acceptance or denial of various applicants based on their
                performance during the conducted interviews.
            </li>
            <li>
                Overseeing the trial period for provisional members. During the
                trial period, I ensure all necessary fees are collected and
                forms completed. Additionally, new members are required to
                contribute to UPE. This can be a new project, involvement in an
                ongoing project, or something decided upon between a provisional
                member and myself.
            </li>
        </ul>

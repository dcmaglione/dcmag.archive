    <h2>ENGAGEMENT COMMITTEE</h2>
    <p>
      I currently serve as the Director of Recruitment for the BU UPE Chapter.
      My term will last through the 2021 - 2022 Academic Year at Boston
      University, and I am a member of the Epsilon Class.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      As the Director of Recruitment, I am responsible for the execution of
      UPE's recruitment process. More specifically, my responsibilities are as
      follows.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Planning events for new potential members. These events can be
        informative, professional, or social and occur throughout the
        recruitment season to ensure all interested students can attend.
      </li>
      <li>
        Facilitating the application process for potential new members. This
        includes creating the general application form, devising and selecting
        programming and logic-based questions for applicant interviews, and
        organizing the logistics, from various perspectives, for the interviews.
      </li>
      <li>
        Running deliberation as current UPE members vote for the acceptance or
        denial of various applicants based on their performance during the
        conducted interviews.
      </li>
      <li>
        Overseeing the trial period for provisional members. During the trial
        period, I ensure all necessary fees are collected and forms completed.
        Additionally, new members are required to contribute to UPE. This can be
        a new project, involvement in an ongoing project, or something decided
        upon between a provisional member and myself.
      </li>
    </ul>

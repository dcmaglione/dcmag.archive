        <h1>COMPUTER SCIENCE AMBASSADORS</h1>
        <p>
            As Computer Science Ambassadors, our mission is to serve as a
            platform for a more collaborative, inclusive, and unified computer
            science community. We achieve this by encouraging and fostering a
            diverse community of students through peer mentorship,
            community-building events, and support from the computer science
            student-led organizations. Ultimately, we want to foster and
            encourage a diverse community, serving as a social network to
            qualify the BU CS experience as a whole.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
            Ambassadors should strive to achieve the following goals to maintain
            an inclusive and innovative CS environment.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Bridge the between Boston University's Computer Science programs
                and the students that benefit from them via active
                communication.
            </li>
            <li>
                Become a reliable resource for computer science students
                regarding classes, clubs, internships, and other resources.
            </li>
            <li>
                Plan and attend semester events to foster a diverse and engaging
                community.
            </li>
            <li>Act as a mentor to a small group of incoming CS freshmen.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>ENGAGEMENT COMMITTEE</h2>
        <p>
            I currently serve on the Engagement Committee for the Computer
            Science Ambassadors. Ambassadors are required to volunteer for at
            least one committee per term. Committees are up to the Executive
            Board to create, delegate, and lead.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
            As a member of the Engagement Committee, I am responsible for
            working on attendance, point checking, forms, and overall
            compliance. This includes tracking the responsibilities of fellow
            ambassadors, offices, and other committees. Additionally, our goal
            is to boost internal and external involvement in the CSA program
            while maintaining close relations with BU faculty.

    <h1>TERRA NOVA [BOSTONHACKS 2020 WINNER]</h1>
    <p>
      Terra Nova is a high-fidelity 3D game designed and built by a team of
      friends and me for the BostonHacks 2020 Hackathon. BostonHacks was our
      first hackathon and helped us build more experience when working with a
      team in a high-stress situation.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      The inspiration for the project was, building a better tomorrow through
      environmental sustainability.
    </p>

    <h2>HOW TO PLAY</h2>
    <p>
      The project begins with having players access the respective website and
      filling out a survey regarding their daily habits and their impact on
      environmental sustainability. Players are then given the ability to
      download the game, supporting Mac or Windows, and enter a 3D world
      composed of simulated houses. Each house is directly attributed to a user
      and generated based on their survey answers. They can tour various homes
      and complete tasks inside their home to reduce an "environmental damage
      score."
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      The objective of Terra Nova is simple, the player's home must be as
      environmentally sustainable as possible. Remember, every little bit
      counts, and every action the player takes will have a global consequence.
      There will be a series of tasks that can be completed in a players home
      based on their survey responses, which were recorded before downloading
      the game. This game is mulitplayer and was designed to encourage
      collaboration so players wont be alone!
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      As more players register and join the game, more homes will manifest
      creating a community. The community will have an overall sustainability
      score, so a player making their home more sustainable will simulataneously
      improve the community environment for everyone.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      Collaboration is necessary to keep earth sustainable and humankind
      healthy. Now get to it, a sustainable world waits for no one.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>

    <h2>TECH STACK</h2>
    <p>
      Terra Nova is a high-fidelity 3D game that communicates in real-time with
      multiple APIs and a custom-built web platform. The game uses a Unity3D
      game engine backend, Google Firebase authentication, Google Sheets data
      collection, and a static GitHub Pages website.
    </p>

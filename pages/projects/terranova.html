    <p>
      As Computer Science Ambassadors, our mission is to serve as a platform for
      a more collaborative, inclusive, and unified computer science community.
      We achieve this by encouraging and fostering a diverse community of
      students through peer mentorship, community-building events, and support
      from the computer science student-led organizations. Ultimately, we want
      to foster and encourage a diverse community, serving as a social network
      to qualify the BU CS experience as a whole.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      Ambassadors should strive to achieve the following goals to maintain an
      inclusive and innovative CS environment.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bridge the between Boston University's Computer Science programs and the
        students that benefit from them via active communication.
      </li>
      <li>
        Become a reliable resource for computer science students regarding
        classes, clubs, internships, and other resources.
      </li>
      <li>
        Plan and attend semester events to foster a diverse and engaging
        community.
      </li>
      <li>Act as a mentor to a small group of incoming CS freshmen.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ENGAGEMENT COMMITTEE</h2>
    <p>
      I currently serve on the Engagement Committee for the Computer Science
      Ambassadors. Ambassadors are required to volunteer for at least one
      committee per term. Committees are up to the Executive Board to create,
      delegate, and lead.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      As a member of the Engagement Committee, I am responsible for working on
      attendance, point checking, forms, and overall compliance. This includes
      tracking the responsibilities of fellow ambassadors, offices, and other
      committees. Additionally, our goal is to boost internal and external
      involvement in the CSA program while maintaining close relations with BU
      faculty.
